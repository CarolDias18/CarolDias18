## About me

I’m an aspiring **Data Scientist**, currently pursuing my **MSc in Data Science**. I’m passionate about turning complex data into meaningful insights and visual stories.  

My strong suit is **data visualization in R**, but I’m actively improving my Python "fluency" while exploring **machine learning projects**.

<br>

## Skills and Tools

**Programming & Data:** R, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SQL  
**Data Visualization:** ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly  
**Machine Learning:** Random Forest, Linear Regression, XGBoost, Model Evaluation  
**Other Tools:** Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

<br>

## Featured Project

### Housing Price Prediction by City

In this project, I:

- Collected and preprocessed housing data by city
- Built **baseline models** (Linear Regression & Random Forest)
- Evaluated models using **R²** and **MAE** (converted to real prices)
- Analyzed **feature importance** for Random Forest models
- Produced **visualizations**: Predicted vs Actual, Residuals, MAE by price quartiles
- Implemented **selective per-city hyperparameter tuning** for improved Random Forest models

**Key insight:** Random Forest performs well at modeling housing prices because it captures non-linear relationships and feature interactions that linear models cannot.


<br>

## Background

Before entering data science, I have a **background in Marine Biology**, where I focused on **shark research and conservation**. This experience taught me how to **analyze complex datasets, identify patterns, and visualize ecological trends**, which directly translates to my current work in data science.
